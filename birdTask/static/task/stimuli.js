// ── Latent change-point documentation ─────────────────────────────
// The latent bird/drone trajectory contains abrupt jumps (change points)
// at specific serial positions within each 50-trial block.  These are
// relevant for the slider-memory test which probes items near boundaries.
//
// High-volatility blocks (vol = 49, blocks 1 & 3):
//   Change points at trials: 3, 5, 11, 19, 25, 37, 39, 47
//   (frequent jumps — mean run length ≈ 49 trials equivalent)
//
// Low-volatility blocks (vol = 4, blocks 2 & 4):
//   Change points at trials: 3, 5, 11, 15, 19, 21, 25, 29, 31, 37, 39, 45, 47
//   (infrequent jumps — mean run length ≈ 4 trials)
//
// The six slider-memory pairs that straddle change points:
//   [2,4]   [11,13]   [16,18]   [22,24]   [34,36]   [39,41]
// For each pair the middle item (3, 12, 17, 23, 35, 40) may or may not
// sit on a change point depending on the block's volatility schedule.
